GitHub supports team collaboration by allowing multiple users to work on the same
repository while tracking all changes. Each team member can contribute files, and
updates are shared through commits and pulls. Version control is important in SQA
because it keeps a history of changes, helps manage test artifacts, and prevents loss
of work. It also improves teamwork and accountability in software projects.
